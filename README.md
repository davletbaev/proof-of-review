# Proof of Review ( June 2019 )
## Portfolio Case

### Description
Proof of Review - is a project where I had convert Figma design mockup to HTML and CSS, and then integrate resulting markup with Wordpress. I decided to use standard workflow with Gulp. I used Nunjucks and SASS for templating. For scripting I used jQuery. Also used Bootstrap 4 Framework because it was used in design.

## Deployment:
1. `git clone git@bitbucket.org:apptech-team/proof-of-review.git`
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn start` - for dev
4. `yarn build` - for build
